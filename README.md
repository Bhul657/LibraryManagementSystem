# Library Management System
The purpose of this project is to create a Library Management System simplify the process of managing traditional library store books and users. The system allows librarians to manage book inventories and student records, while students want to borrow and return books. The system also handles overdue fines and provides a user-friendly interface to search for books which are available in our library (It is only for a demo Project, so we have entered only 4/5 entries). This system is designed to address these issues faced by librarian and staff providing a digital platform for keeping record of add, update, edit, search, remove records of Book, Student different kinds of information. 

In this project, we have been tasked with designing and implementing the system using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, including class structures, database integration, and GUI development. Libraries often struggle with manual record-keeping, which leads to inefficiencies in book management, user tracking, and overdue fine collection. By introducing an automated system, this project enhances accuracy, reduces workload, and improves overall library service management. This application is based on a desktop application integrated with Database (MySQL), JavaFx which is essential for library functionality.
